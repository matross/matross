Matross loves you and cares about you. Matross wants you to relax and get some sleep.
Matross wants you to snuggle up with a good book and a glass of scotch and enjoy life.
Matross wants to see you go outside and enjoy the sun and not worry about computers.

Other process automation utilities are sadistic. They want to see you cry. They lure you in with
a sense of simplicity and ease of use only to turn around and force their psychotic tendencies on you.
They draw you in and then bind your hands and try to shove you into some multi-layered abstraction that
leaks everywhere all over your nice new clothes.

Matross just wants to help.
